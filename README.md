<b>Description:</b>

This app is a recreation of a palette generator. The user can generate random color schemes, create projects, and save multiple palettes to a project as well as have multiple projects. The user can also lock a color if they want to keep that specific color but generate new other colors. The user can also delete a palette after saving it. All projects and palettes are stored in the database and persist on page reload. This app was made in a week. It is tested with mocha and chai.
